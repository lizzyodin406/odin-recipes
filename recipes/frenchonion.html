        <li> 1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp dry sherry</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 quarts beef stock</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>4 sprigs fresh thyme</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h4>Make the Onion Soup</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large Dutch Oven, over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and the butter. Once the butter has melted and begins to foam, add the sliced onions and 1 teaspoon of kosher salt. Stir to combine, then cover and cook for 15 minutes, undisturbed.</li>
        <li>Uncover and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the onions are caramelized, about 35 – 45 minutes. Lower the heat if you find that the onions are browning too quickly. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Pour in the white wine and dry sherry, scraping all the browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Once boiling, stir in the flour and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook for about 1 minute or until the mixture thickens.</li>
        <li>Add the beef stock, Worcestershire sauce, thyme and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer, cover and cook for 20 minutes. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.</li>
    </ol>
        <h4>Toast The Bread</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>While the soup is simmering, preheat oven to 450ºF.</li>
        <li>Arrange the bread slices on a baking sheet, covered with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Brush the bread on both sides with the remaining olive oil.</li>
        <li>Toast the bread in the oven for 10 – 15 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown.</li>
        <li>As soon as the bread is out of the oven, rub the garlic on the top side. Reserve.</li>
    </ol>
        <h4>Assemble the French Onion Soup Bowl</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat broiler and adjust oven rack to top position.</li>
        <li>Place 4 (or 8 if making appetizer sized soups) ovenproof bowls or ramekins on the baking sheet. Ladle the soup into the bowls, dividing equally, then top with the bread slices, garlic rubbed size up. Top with the Gruyere and parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Place bowls under the broiler and broil until the cheese is melted and is browned in spots.</li>
        <li>Garnish with thyme and serve!!</li>
    </ol>
